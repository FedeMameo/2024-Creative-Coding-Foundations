#My Emoji Name
##Lara Rodrigues Ristic
###The idea is that when we type our name we get the emoji-fied version of it. 
Every letter is assigned with an emoji output in javascript. There is no repeating emojis but when we type the same letter twice we get the emoji twice. When I understand better the concept about arrays and randomizing selections I want to make it not repeat emojis when the same letter is typed two or more times.
