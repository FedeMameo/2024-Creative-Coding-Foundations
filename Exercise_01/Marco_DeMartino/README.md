# Cone hat

This projects is just a silly little game done to explore the concept of a button and
its possible outputs, ranging from the start of an animation, the change of an image and
the change of the display property of a div.
I also explored a bit more in depth js arrow function, variables (with functions inside, but I don't know if it's bad practice) and
else if statements.
