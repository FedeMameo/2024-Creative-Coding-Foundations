# Meme Generator

## Exercise 1

This exercise based on my creation with the typewriter was directed at using meme buttons. Select the section you want to have fun with and there will be three pictures per section that will start randomly. The sentences will also start randomly, although they are constructed so that the top and bottom are together, but they separate to create even more options. From here I should expand the meme images.
