## Concept description

Bop Tuner is an experimental web-site designed to have fun while training your musical note recognition.

The user is free to play the various notes (under the watchful eye of Bop) and, when he feels ready, he can interact with Bop by clicking on it. At this point Bop emits a note and the user's task is to recognize it by playing it in the keyboard below. The correct recognition is manifested through the explosion of confetti: you can try as many times as you want and you will always have your confetti prize, once you play the correct note.
For more competitive players, however, a counter in the top right increases only when correct guesses occur without errors, i.e. on the first attempt. If you guess three in a row, you will get a bigger prize!

With this first assignment I wanted to experiment with the TypeWriter example, trying to evolve it into a bit more complex structure:
Input A --> Output A --> Input B --> Output B
- Input A = clicking on Bop
- Output A = random note by Bop
- Input B = clicking the button of the corresponding note
- Output B = selected note + confetti explosion (if it is right)
