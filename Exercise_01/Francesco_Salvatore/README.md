# Project title: The Unveiling Typewriter

## Author: Francesco Salvatore

## Concept description

The Unveiling Typewriter is an experimental website created by and designed for those who feel the weight of anachronism. People who are contemporary in the sense of Agamben (What is the Contemporary?). These individuals see beyond the surface, finding meanings hidden from plain sight.

To develop and heighten this sensitivity, a simple exercise is offered: choose a few words from a given text that resonate with you. By connecting these words, a new meaning will emerge beyond the surface.

At the beginning of the website, there is a series of buttons, each represented by a word, leading to phrases created during a previous exercise that worked on the text "The Way of Masks" by Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss.

Afterward, the user is invited to take part in the exercise, this time based on an excerpt from "Moby Dick." If users don't feel like re-reading the text, a button will randomly generate words from the provided passage.

Finally, it would be interesting to collect the data generated by users through this exercise. The user is invited to reflect on the created phrase and produce any kind of output, whether it's a thought, a poem, a drawing, or anything else. Even the use of AI is encouraged.

In the future, the final section will feature a submit button where users can upload their outputs, which will be analyzed and showcased on a dedicated page to follow.
