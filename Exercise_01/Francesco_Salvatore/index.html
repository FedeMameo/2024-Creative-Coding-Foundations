            <p>Anachronism reflects the deep yearning of those who feel misunderstood in a world that rushes forward
                without them. Imagine a soul wandering through a bustling city, carrying the weight of dreams from a
                simpler time. Their heart beats to a different rhythm, longing for genuine connections amidst the noise
                of modern life. They see beauty in forgotten traditions and value the depth of conversation over the
                superficiality of fleeting trends. This dissonance creates a poignant sense of longing, as they navigate
                a landscape that feels foreign. In their quest for understanding, they remind us all to pause, listen,
                and cherish what truly matters.</p>

            The machine presents various results achieved through a mechanism that encourages individuals to grasp
            insights beyond the visible. Starting from an excerpt of the book "The Way of Masks" by Claude Lévi-Strauss,
            the exercise involves identifying a specific number of words that resonate with the reader, jotting them
            down on paper, and then connecting them in a way that forms an evocative sentence. Click the button that
            inspires you the most to read some examples that have been created.</p>

        <h2>Read this passage</h2>

        <!-- Text from Moby Dick/any book -->
        <p id="book-text">"Call me Ishmael; some years ago, never mind how long precisely, I had little or no money in
            my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore. So, whenever I find myself growing grim about the
            mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing
            before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos
            get such an upper hand of me that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately
            stepping into the street and methodically knocking people’s hats off, then I account it high time to get to
            sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish, Cato throws
            himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the sea. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it,
            almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean
            with me. There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral
            reefs; commerce surrounds it with her surf. As the Sea washes the world’s shores, so the currents of
            mankind, sea-like, flow and ebb; and the tides of mankind have the same effect. There is a wisdom that comes
            from experience, and there are certain discoveries that are worth their weight in gold. I am forever
            mesmerized by the rolling waves and the churning foam of the sea; it stirs a restlessness deep within me. My
            soul craves the salty air, the wild wind, and the unending horizon. It beckons me with promises of adventure
            and escape from the mundanity of life. With every passing ship, I feel the pull of the sea, a longing for
            the distant lands that wait beyond the horizon. The vastness of the ocean reflects the depths of my own
            spirit, inviting me to explore its uncharted waters. So, I thought I would sail for a while to cleanse my
            soul and seek my fortune. Leaving the city’s hustle and bustle behind, I envisioned the serenity of the open
            waters and the thrill of life aboard a ship. The scent of the ocean was calling me, filling my senses with
            anticipation. In the harbor, ships bobbed gently in the waves, their sails billowing like the wings of great
            birds poised for flight. I could hear the distant calls of sailors preparing for departure, the clang of
            metal on metal, and the creaking of wood as vessels swayed in the tide. I wandered the docks, my heart
            racing with each sight of the ropes and sails, the promise of the journey ahead. Among the ships, I found a
            whaling vessel, the Pequod, ready to set sail for the vast and mysterious sea. I was captivated by its
            sturdy hull and the tales of adventure whispered by those who had ventured before me. The captain, a man
            named Ahab, was said to be a fierce and passionate leader, consumed by his own obsessions. I knew then that
            I had to join this ship to become part of its legacy, to chase the great whale that had eluded so many. And
            so it was that I found myself aboard the Pequod, surrounded by a diverse crew, each man carrying his own
            dreams and desires. The sails were hoisted, the anchor raised, and as we sailed out of the harbor, I felt a
            surge of excitement coursing through me. The city faded into the distance, and the open sea stretched before
            us, a world of infinite possibilities. The wind filled our sails, propelling us forward into the unknown.
            Each wave that crashed against the bow was a reminder of the adventure that awaited us. I was no longer just
            Ishmael, the restless wanderer; I was a sailor, a seeker of the deep, embarking on a journey that would test
            my spirit and redefine my existence. The ocean would reveal its secrets to those brave enough to dive into
            its depths, and I was ready to embrace whatever lay ahead."</p>
