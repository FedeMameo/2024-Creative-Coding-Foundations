## Concept description
‘Encrypted' is a project that reproduces the feel of a typewriter. Users click virtual buttons for letters, numbers and spaces to generate text. At first the output text is encrypted, only by typing the hidden sequence - the code - ‘007’ does a secret character transformation take place, adding a playful touch. It combines retro typing with modern web design for a fun and dynamic experience.
