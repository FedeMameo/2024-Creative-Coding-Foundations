## This is an interactive web-based game where the player controls a car navigating through three different tracks which are three arrays in the Javascript code. The objective is to avoid traps, keep the car's health intact, and reach the finish line as quickly as possible. Players control the car's movement using the arrow keys or WASD keys, and must navigate around traps scattered across the tracks.

Key Features
Dynamic Movement: Players control the car’s movement across three tracks, avoiding traps along the way.
Health Management: Stepping on a trap reduces the car’s health, and the game ends when health reaches zero.
Track Selection: Three tracks are available, each with different trap placements.
Fireworks Effect: When the player reaches the finish line, fireworks are triggered as a celebration.
Game Reset: After the game ends, players can restart the game by pressing a reset button.
