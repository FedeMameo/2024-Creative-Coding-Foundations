# Exercise 03

## Brief

The assignment is inspired to the Squid Games, and the goal is to build a game around it, where the player can move forward one step, or jump to avoid the traps on the bridge. The goal is to go through the bridge with the right sequence without stepping on any traps. The player will fail if any trap is triggered, and it will have to start back from the beginning of the bridge, to try again.

The graphics, interactions, sounds etc. can be added as pleased.
