## Concept description
Mario Bridge Adventure is a simple web-based game where players help Mario cross a series of platforms to rescue the princess. Each step or jump brings Mario closer to the goal, but some platforms hide traps that will send him back to the start. The game features responsive controls, with arrow keys and spacebar support on desktop, and touch buttons on mobile devices.
