# Christmas Game

## Antonia Siran

### Everybody's getting ready for Christmas, so let's help Santa bring all the gifts

A simple, interactive Christmas-themed platform game where a character navigates through obstacles like ice, trees, and snowmen to reach the end. The game includes a responsive design that adjusts the number of platforms based on screen size, animations for movement, and a modal for win/lose messages with options to retry or start a new game.
