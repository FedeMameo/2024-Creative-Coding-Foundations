## Concept description
Starting from the work we did in class, this game uses very simple controls (space & right arrow) to move the hero accross the game tiles. Winning is very simple (but not easy) in that you need to avoid all the traps and reach the end of the bridge, for a sweet surprise. I've also included a tile progress counter, as well as a toggle help menu for instructions.
