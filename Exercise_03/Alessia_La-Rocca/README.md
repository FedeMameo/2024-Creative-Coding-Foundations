## Concept description
This project is a simple game where a player moves along a path, avoiding traps. The path is represented by squares, and the player advances by pressing keys. Random traps are generated on the path, and the player must avoid them to reach the end safely. If the player steps on a trap, they lose; if they reach the end, they win. The game features dynamic updates of the player's position and trap status, with a reset mechanism to start over after each win or loss.
