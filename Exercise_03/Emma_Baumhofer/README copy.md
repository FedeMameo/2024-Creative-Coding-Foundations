# Project title: Frogger - Catch the flies, avoid the mowers!

## Author: Emma Baumhofer

## Concept description: Inspired by the 1997 version of the classic computer game Frogger. The player uses simple "big hop" or "small hop" movements to try to guess which colored blocks are safe and reach the other side to catch the flies. If the frog falls through the trap they are run over by the lawn mower. The colors and the order of the traps in the path are shuffled with each new round.
