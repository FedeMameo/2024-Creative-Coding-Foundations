# Go Bot, Go!

## Luca Enrico Spallino

## Concept description

Set in the year 2100, during a Luddist revolution against machines, "Go, Bot Go!" is a game where a small robot, named Bot, must cross a dangerous, unstable bridge during his escape from the rebels. The bridge is monitored by a human guard, adding an element of risk as the robot attempts to make its way across without falling.

The game is inspired by the logic of Squid Game, where players must carefully time their movements and decisions to avoid danger. The environment and characters have been designed by myself using Piskel, a browser-based pixel art tool, with all images for the animations created in this program.

The game features sound effects that follow an 8-bit aesthetic, sourced from Pixabay. These sounds are triggered by specific actions, such as the robot's movement or the collapse of parts of the bridge, enhancing the retro atmosphere of the game.
