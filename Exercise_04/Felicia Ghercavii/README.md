Book titles API

## Concept description
This Public Library API had a huge amount of data which I could select from, I decided to use it for its versatility, but halfway through I realised this is now actually a really cool tool! 

The page displays a randomly arranged & styled "cloud" of subjects which are found in books on 5 different topics (objects): math, physics, design, art, astronomy. Clicking on a subject displays a list of book titles, together with the authors, first publishing year & a picture of the book cover. (I've already noted down some new titles)
