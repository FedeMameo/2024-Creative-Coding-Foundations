# Title: Timezone Calculator

## Author: Emma Baumhofer 

## Description: The Timezone Calculator is a tool that simplifies finding meeting times with dispersed teammates around the world.

## License for Timezone API
This project uses the timezone API by Dmitriy Filipenko, licensed under the MIT License https://github.com/dmfilipenko/timezones.json?tab=MIT-1-ov-file. 

## Note: The Timezone API does not account for Daylight Savings Time, which means that currently, the results are off by one hour. For a future version of the tool, it would be better to switch to a different API, such as TimeAPI: https://www.timeapi.io/, that dynamically accounts for DST.
