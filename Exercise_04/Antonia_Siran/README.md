## Description

What Are We Watching? is a web application designed to showcase top-rated movies. The website allows users to filter movies based on genre, release year, and rating order. Users can also click on a movie poster to view detailed information about the selected movie.

The website displays movies in an organized and visually appealing layout. Each movie is shown as a card with its poster and rating, making it easy for users to browse. Filters are available to narrow down the movie selection by genre and release year, while a sorting option lets users view movies in order of their ratings, either from highest to lowest or vice versa.
