## Concept description
The Marvel Characters Viewer is a dynamic web application that allows users to explore and interact with a database of Marvel characters. Users can search for characters by name, filter results based on the availability of comics, and sort the list by the number of comics in ascending or descending order.
The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with API's data dynamically loaded from a JSON file.
