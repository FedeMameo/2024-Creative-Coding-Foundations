# Project title: Pop Pokémon

## Author: Francesco Salvatore

## Concept description

This tool is designed to help graphic designers, Pokémon fans, or anyone with a love for Japanese aesthetics to find joy and inspiration. It provides:

Enter the name of your favorite Pokémon, and the tool will instantly fetch its Japanese name, Pokédex ID number, and the official image. By combining these details, you’ll have all the building blocks to create a visually compelling vintage Japanese poster.

How It Works
Start by entering the name of your favorite Pokémon.
Key Details are given:
The Pokémon’s Japanese name.
Its unique ID number in the official Pokédex.
The official image of the Pokémon.
Start Designing: Use these details as the foundation for your vintage-style Japanese poster. Incorporate the Pokémon’s name in kanji or kana, highlight its Pokédex number as a design element, and utilize its image to create an authentic look.

Data
The data collected in the JSON file comes from the API [https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/). The dataset has been limited to Generation 1 Pokémon to manage a smaller volume of data. From the available data, I extracted key elements relevant to my concept (Pokédex index, name, and official image). Using ChatGPT, I automated the creation of a new key, "japaneseName," which automatically translates the "name" field into Japanese.
