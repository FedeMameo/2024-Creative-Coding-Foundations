# Creative Coding Foundations Course
SUPSI MAInD
CAS1 17.10-5.12.2024

# What you will learn
- Foundational knowledge of programming topics and coding principles that can be applied to most fields and applications
- Fundamentals of web languages (HTML, CSS) with the main focus on plain JavaScript
- Knowledge for creating interactive web interfaces with multimedia contents, communication with simple physical devices (Arduino boards, for example), data management, and manipulations
- How to use industry-standard development tools like Visual Studio Code and GitHub

# Description
The course aims to provide students with a broad introduction to coding, with a special focus on human-computer interaction. It is based on web technologies and integrated with data and information from multimedia files, data, and the physical world.

Every week, the students will learn and apply new programming principles and techniques in a one-day class consisting of the following sessions: a lecture about programming given by the teachers, practical exercises with support from the teaching staff, and class assignment development.

The assignments aim to build an experience in programming for the rest of the master's program.

The course will include a one-day introductory practical lesson about electronics and simple schematics for properly connecting essential electronics components like buttons, potentiometers, and LEDs.

Those components are at the core of any user interaction with physical interfaces. The Arduino ecosystem will read and control those electronic components via the computer (and later within a webpage).
