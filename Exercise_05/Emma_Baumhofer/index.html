                <h1>Litany</h1>
                <p>You are the bread and the knife,
                <br>The crystal goblet and the wine...
                <br>-Jacques Crickillon
                <br>
                <br>You are the bread and the knife,
                <br>the crystal goblet and the wine.
                <br>You are the dew on the morning grass
                <br>and the burning wheel of the sun.
                <br>You are the white apron of the baker,
                <br>and the marsh birds suddenly in flight.
                <br>
                <br>However, you are not the wind in the orchard,
                <br>the plums on the counter,
                <br>or the house of cards.
                <br>And you are certainly not the pine-scented air.
                <br>There is just no way that you are the pine-scented air.
                <br>
                <br>It is possible that you are the fish under the bridge,
                <br>maybe even the pigeon on the general's head,
                <br>but you are not even close
                <br>to being the field of cornflowers at dusk.
                <br>
                <br>And a quick look in the mirror will show
                <br>that you are neither the boots in the corner
                <br>nor the boat asleep in its boathouse.                    <br>
                <br>It might interest you to know,
                <br>speaking of the plentiful imagery of the world,
                <br>that I am the sound of rain on the roof.
                <br>
                <br>I also happen to be the shooting star,
                <br>the evening paper blowing down an alley
                <br>and the basket of chestnuts on the kitchen table.
                <br>
                <br>I am also the moon in the trees
                <br>and the blind woman's tea cup.
                <br>But don't worry, I'm not the bread and the knife.
                <br>You are still the bread and the knife.
                <br>You will always be the bread and the knife,
                <br>not to mention the crystal goblet and—somehow—the wine.
                <br><br>
