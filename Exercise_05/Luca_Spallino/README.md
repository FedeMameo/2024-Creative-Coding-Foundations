# SoundViz

## Luca Enrico Spallino

## Concept description

The site allows users to visualize the sounds they are emitting into the computer's microphone.

SoundViz converts the audio data collected from the microphone into a bar chart, which is then transformed using Java into a fan-shaped visualization, with an HSL tone that varies depending on the sound's intensity.

Users are free to customize the visualization by changing parameters such as the thickness of the bars, the blur effect, and the primary hue.
