# Project title: Dynamic Audio Visualizer

## Author: Francesco Salvatore

## Concept description

This project is a web-based application that transforms live microphone input into a stunning, real-time audio visualization. Users can customize the visualization's appearance using interactive sliders for hue, minimum radius, and other properties, making it a versatile tool for exploring sound visually.

How it work

The application accesses the microphone and processes the audio to extract frequency data. This data is mapped to a circular visualization on a canvas element, where each frequency value determines the radius. Users can customize the visualization in real-time using sliders to adjust the hue and overall size.
