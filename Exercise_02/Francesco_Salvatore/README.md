# Project title: The Interactive Generator

## Author: Francesco Salvatore

## Concept description

The interactive generator is a simple game inspired from the work of the ex-1.

From the sentences created during the exercise, I generated some AI images. Now, it's your turn to create the prompts.

How does it work? By clicking the green button, an image with a text box underneath will appear. Modify the text by writing how you would prompt AI to create that image. You can generate up to 5 images at a time, and donâ€™t worry, there are plenty more. If an image doesn't impress you, delete it and generate a new one, or keep going when you're satisfied.

When you click inside the text box, the placeholder text will disappear so you can type freely. Write as much as you like, text boxes will never overlap.

Always keep in mind that this is a second page of a website (homepage is ex n1 that's why it is linked inside of the html). I only upload the cache relative to the ex-2 but if you are interested in visualizing the works linked I can alway upload the entire cache.
