## Concept description
The site implements the basic functionality of a to-do list, and I created a “main-box” in HTML structure that contains three boxes related to the process of the user experiencing the to-do list. 
First, the user can write down a task and select a start date and deadline. And it will create a new "div" in the "to do" box, it will list the tasks user created in a row, and allow user to mark it as done or just delete it. When user marked one task, it goes into the third box.
And the website used the local storage function to save the data of tasks, when user reflash the browser, it will still there.
For the PC user, overflow is not allowed to keep the interface design. And for the mobile phones overflow-y is allow and the three boxes are aligned in the row for using easily.
I did sketches by hand of interfaces before start coding, and used the Chatgpt to optimise the code and add the features that I need in Javascript.
