#Trip Memories
Trip Memories is a web project that allows users to create and organize a diary of their travels. The page is divided into two main sections: an input area and a display area. In the input area, users can enter travel details, including the place, date, positive and negative memories, cost, and upload memorable images. Each trip can be customized with a unique color and a country flag representing the visited location.

Each trip is then displayed in the viewing area, where experiences are organized by date in an appealing and responsive layout. This project is designed to provide a simple and enjoyable experience, enabling travelers to save and revisit their cherished memories in an organized and customizable way.
