# byte_board

## Luca Enrico Spallino

## Concept description

byte_board is an experimental web-site designed to visualize different type of files relating them to their data bytes.

Users can upload their files, choose a color from the rgb picker and generate a visualization of the file bytes   in a square. Users have the opportunity to upload a maximum of 10 different files, remove them individually and see the original file while hovering on a square.

Different denominations (.png, .midi, .docx) will provide different visualizations, allow users to discover what lies behind their files.
