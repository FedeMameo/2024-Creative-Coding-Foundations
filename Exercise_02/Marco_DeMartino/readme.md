# My Diary

## Marco De Martino

## The concept is reallt simple. The user can upload a diary entry with a title, some text content and a background color for the note.

## Posting a note creates a data entry on the side panel, clicking on the date opens the diary entries posted on that date.

## Also, the concept of "posting something" made me think of a chat or some kind of social network, I tried with that at first, made a rudimentary server and database with node.js, but got lost trying to use socket.io and express with vercel and firebase. After that I went back to my concept and created something simpler, but still I wanted to implement something that could keep the user datas and so I explored a bit the use of "localStorage", so the creation of objects, saving them to the localStorage and loading them (to understand all of this concepts I looked up the documentation and got help from chatGPT to explain them in ways I could actually understand).
