# Intro Exercise 1

Introduction to the first exercise of the course with the introduction of some basic JavaScript interactions and concepts.

## Brief of the exercise

Starting from the “TypeMachine” exercise during the lesson, work on a concept for your version and develop it. Use the JS knowledge gained during the course; adding more feature types isn’t strictly necessary, but exploring is welcome. Mainly work on getting familiar with HTML and CSS, the naming conventions, file structure (correct indentation), naming style (kebab-case, camel-case), and selections (both in CSS and JS).
