# Lesson 01

## My First Page

Introduction to HTML and CSS.

## Intro Exercise 1

Introduction to the first exercise of the course with the use of some basic JavaScript interactions and concepts.

### Brief of the exercise

Starting from the “TypeMachine” exercise done during the lesson, work on a concept for your version and develop it. Use the JS knowledge gained during the course; adding more feature types isn’t strictly necessary, but exploring is welcome. Mainly work on getting familiar with HTML and CSS, the naming conventions, file structure (correct indentation), naming style (kebab-case, camelCase), and selections (both in CSS and JS).
