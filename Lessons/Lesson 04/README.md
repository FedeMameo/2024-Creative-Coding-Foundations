# Lesson 04

## Load and display data from an internal JSON file

Introduction to the use of the fetch function to load, parse and display a JSON dataset.


## Load and display data from an API

Introduction to the use of data from external API endpoints.


### Brief of the assignment

Starting from an online API, implement a web page that:
- allows the user to visually see the data (at least 3 objects)
- allows the user to interact with some visual elements
- allows to see something even if the data are not available 
- is responsive


**For security reasons**:  the submission in GitHub includes a static JSON file containing the data extracting from the API, not the link to the API (and related API key).
