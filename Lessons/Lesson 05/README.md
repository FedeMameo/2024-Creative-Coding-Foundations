### Brief of the assignment


Starting from an online API, implement a web page that:
- allows the user to visually see the data (at least 3 objects)
- allows the user to interact with some visual elements
- allows to see something even if the data are not available 
- is responsive


**For security reasons**: The submission in GitHub includes a static JSON file containing the data. Do not include the link to the API.
